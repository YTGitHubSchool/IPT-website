				<h2>Video</h2>
				<p>Videos are often one of the best ways to explain concepts or introduce exciting elements into a multimedia product. A video will take more resources to create compared to other forms of media, but it is the easiest way of effectively convey information and keep user interest. There are two ways of creating a video, by using a video camera or recording a video with software on a computer. Usually videos will go through editing before it is incorporated into a project, when a video is edited, other forms of media is added like text and audio, this effectively makes video files take the most amount of storage, it is also the most hardware demanding. If the video is uploaded onto the internet in an uncompressed format, it would take an extremely long time to load which will make the user lose interest very quickly defeating the purpose of creating the video.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Improvements to technology over the past few years has allowed the creation of multimedia products to become easier and higher in quality. Many companies are now including better images with higher resolution scale and colour accuracy, videos with higher framerates and resolution and audio with better sound quality. This has started to push the limits of consumer’s hardware which led to people developing compression and file formats that utilizes these techniques to reduce the large amount of storage required for these uncompressed files.</p>
				<p>Compressing files increases storage efficiency and file transfer speed which benefits the consumers and developers. The amount a file is compressed is measured by the compression ratio. The compression ratio shows how much smaller the compressed file is compared to the original file, a compression ratio of 2 to 1 (2:1) means that the compressed file is half the size of the uncompressed file. The two main compression techniques used to reduce file size is lossy and lossless.</p>

				<h2>Compression techniques</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="lossy">
				<h3>Lossy</h3>
				<p>Lossy compression removes some bytes from the file, this results in a higher compression ratio, but the quality is reduced. This compression technique is most often used on video and audio by removing the pitches and fine details of an image that usually wouldn’t be noticeable allowing the file size to be reduced by a large amount.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="lossless">
				<h3>Lossless</h3>
				<p>Lossless compression allows the original file to be recovered completely. This compression technique reduces the file size by replacing repeated data with something that takes less storage. Lossless compression is usually used on text documents, spreadsheets and database files because all the data in the file must remain unchanged. For example, in a text document a word might be repeated multiple times like ‘the’, it replaces this word with a one-character symbol or token to reduce the file size without losing any data in the compression process.</p>

				<h2>Images</h2>
				<p>Higher quality images have become a lot easier to obtain or create now, anyone with access to the internet can easily download images with high resolution. High quality images significantly impact the performance of a multimedia product and take up lots of storage. The storage requirements of images are dependent on the number, size, tone and colour of each pixel. The bit depth of an image determines the number of colours that an image can have. The more bits per pixel an image has the larger the file size of the image becomes. This can be calculated with the following equation.</p>

				<p>The original image file was around 31 MB, after exporting the file into a JPEG image the file size droped down to around 1 MB. There was no noticeable change in quality after the compression so obtimizing images for project will increase the efficiency of workflow and allow faster loading for the consumer and the developer.</p>

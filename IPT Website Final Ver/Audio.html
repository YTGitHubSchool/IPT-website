				<h2>Sound</h2>
				<p>When recording audio, the microphone picks up the sound waves that travel through the air, sound waves are analog data which computers are unable to understand, so an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to digitise the data, so the computer can utilize and store it. When the audio is played back to someone listening it, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is used to allow the audio to be played through speakers or headphones. The ADC uses a method called sampling to digitise the sound waves that are being picked up by the microphone, there are three important characteristic that determines the sound quality and the size of the audio file.</p>

				<h3>Sampling rate</h3>
				<p>The sampling rate is the amount of times a sample is taken from the sound wave, the two most common sampling rates are 44.1 kHz which is 44 100 samples per second and 22.05 kHz which is 22 050 samples per second. Higher sampling rates are used for better sound quality, but this will increase the amount of space taken by the file. The sample size is the number of bits per sample.</p>

				<h3>Sampling size</h3>
				<p>Sample size is the number of bits per sample. The most commonly used sample sizes are 8-bit and 16-bit. Higher bit resolution gives better sound quality. 16-bit is usually used for songs for the better sound quality and would be wasting storage space if it was used for a recording of just talking so 8-bit audio is used for that.</p>

			<div class="monostereo">
				<h3>Mono and Stereo</h3>
				<p>Audio can come in two different types, mono and stereo. Mono uses one channel of sound, and stereo uses two channels, stereo is regarded as having better sound quality.</p>

			<div class="calsound">
				<h3>Caculating audio file size</h3>
				<p>To calculate the file size of audio, the sample rate, sample size and time in seconds are multiplied together and if the audio file is stereo, then the result of the calculation is then multiplied by two.</p>
